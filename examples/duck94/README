MAIN SCRIPTS IN THIS DIRECTORY:

This directory contains tests of the 1DVarS codes, using data from the
Duck94 field experiment.  The tests are organized into two main
scripts, which themselves call a few utilities (directory 'util').

1) duck94AdjiontSensitivity*.m: Demonstration of uncertainty
   quantification using adjoint sensitivity analysis, to quantify how
   different model variables impact outputs for Duck94.

2) duck94ForwardRun.m: If you just want to try a forward model run
   with no bathymetry assimilation.  Can be useful for quick(er) tests
   when adding new physics to the model, or trying different parameter
   combinations.  Note, hydro observations are still assimilated to
   correct hydrodynamics, but sediment transport is not corrected by
   assimilation.

NOTE, if you are running any of these tests, make sure that the main
src directory of the 1DVarS repo, and all its' sub-directories, are in
your path.

OTHER SUB-DIRECTORIES IN THIS DIRECTORY:

A) obsdataCache: Contains cached versions of specific observational
   data used by duck94TwoPhaseInversion.m.  These are stored on github
   to provide the minimal datasets needed for running the example.

B) utils: Contains sub-functions called by the main scripts.
