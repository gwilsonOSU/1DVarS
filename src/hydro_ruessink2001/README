This was copied from here on April 19, 2019:

~/work/writing/published/JTECH2018_uavInversion/experiments/sourcecode_withMixing/waveModel/

After copying, some variable input/output names were changed, and the
model name was changed from waveModel to hydroModel.  These changes
help the code conform to my sediment transport TL-AD codes developed
in parent directory
