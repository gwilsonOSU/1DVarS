A nice way to debug AD symmetry is demonstrated in
ad_qtrans_vanderA_tester.m.  The strategy is to add optional inputs of
'invar' or 'outvar' in the AD and TL models, respectively.  These
override the input/output variables of the code (and, for the AD
model, no longer initialize the desired input variable to zero, but
initialize the "default" AD input variable to zero).  Then use grep to
find all of the TL variables in the order they appear in the TL code.
One by one, run the TL-AD symmetry check for each of these variables.
No need to comment out any code blocks in either TL or AD code during
these tests.

Most likely the TL-AD symmetry test will pass for a few of the
variables in order, then break at some point.  When the TL-AD symmetry
breaks, that means there is a bug affecting that part of the AD code.
This made it very easy to isolate the bug and debug the AD code.
