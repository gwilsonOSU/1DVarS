This example cases uses the expreimental data from Silva et
al. (2011), as described in JHR_SI_P3973_Final.doc.

Fig. 8 in van der A et al. (2013) shows a comparison to this data set,
6-pointed stars, restricted to cases with nonzero mean current.

I copied the expreimental params from Silva et al. (2011) and ran them
with my matlab version of VDA13 to check if I have implemented the
model correctly for cases with nonzero mean flow.  The results do not
reproduce VDA13 Fig. 8 exactly... in fact it is slightly better.  As
of now I don't know the reason for the discrepancies, perhaps it is a
slight difference in how VDA13 calculates the wave crest/trough
timings.  In any event, I am satisfied that my version of code is
reproducing the experimental data.
