MAIN SCRIPTS IN THIS DIRECTORY:

This directory contains tests of the 1DVarS codes, using data from the
Duck94 field experiment.  The tests are organized into two main
scripts, which themselves call a few utilities (directory 'util').

1) duck94TwoPhaseInversion.m: Uses a two-phase approach to assimilate
   data and predict bar migrations.  Phase-1 corrects hydrodynamic
   errors, while phase-2 corrects sediment transport errors.  The two
   phases are cycled iteratively, until both hydro and sediment
   transport are accurate.

2) (TODO) duck94AdjiontSensitivity.m: Demonstration of uncertainty
   quantification, using adjoint sensitivity analysis to quantify how
   different model variables impact model accuracy for Duck94.

NOTE, if you are running these, make sure that the main src directory
of the 1DVarS repo, and all its' sub-directories, are in your path.

OTHER SUB-DIRECTORIES IN THIS DIRECTORY:

A) data: Contains a LOT of observational data from the Duck94
   experiment.  This is *not* stored in the github repo because it's
   4.7GB total size.  If you are reading ./util/prepObsData.m and
   wondering where the 'data' directory is, there is your answer.

B) obsdataCache: Contains cached versions of specific observational
   data used by duck94TwoPhaseInversion.m.  These *are* stored on
   github and provide the minimal datasets needed for running
   duck94TwoPhaseInversion.m.

C) utils: Contains sub-functions called by the main scripts.
